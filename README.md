## NEISS

The NEISS study (as in National Electronic Injury Surveillance System) records injury data associated with consumer products, and seen in a representative sample of hospitals (96 in 2021) of differing sizes and locations in the United States, including children's hospitals.

Each dataset contains for each case the statistical weight to transfer the number of cases from the probabilistic sample to the entire US popolation.

Besides the main table, there are three linked tables (`body_parts`, `diagnosis` and `products`) necessary because of multiple responses.

An ancillary lookup table `attributes` details the labels associated with each categorical variable.
